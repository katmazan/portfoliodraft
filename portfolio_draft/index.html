    <p>I am an empathetic (according to personality tests) 
    designer and researcher who is passionate about people and making 
    their lives easier. When designing I put people and accessability first. 
    In my free time I enjoy playing ambient games, watching crime documentaries, 
    and listening to pop music.</p>
