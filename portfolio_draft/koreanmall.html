    <p>Over the summer I worked at an e-commerce company in Seoul.  After conducting competitive research and interviews with users I developed several prototypes of how the company may want to organize their merchandise and display their reviews page. My main focus was to improve the navigation of the site as well as to improve the clarity of translations on the site.  While there, I also created some simple advertisements to display on their homepage during promotions.</p>
