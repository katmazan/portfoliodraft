    <p>During my Winter 2018 semester I was paired with a group 
        of other students to analyze the usability of the Dining 
        portion of the Michigan App.  Throughout this process we 
        conducted user tests and interviews, administered surveys, 
        and created user personas to identify the key problems with 
        the Dining App.  In the end we focused on the lack of fluidity 
        in the application and conducted A/B testing on the Location 
        aspect using paper prototypes that tested the ability for users 
        to decide if they wanted to leave the Michigan App to go to 
        Google Maps or not. In line with our hypothesis, most users said 
        that they preferred being notified that they were about to leave the application.
